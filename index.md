### Current position
I am a data analyst excited by working with data and using it to deliver insights and solutions.

This involves learning data analytics using Excel, SQL, Tableau, Python and R. <br> I used my recent career break to learn Power BI and gain Microsoft Power BI Data Analyst Associate certification. <br>
In my previous development role I was involved with Agile web API development using C# , .net Core and SQL Server. I also have experience in .net Winforms applications. <br>
I worked closely with key users throughout the business to make sure that applications delivered what was needed.<br>
