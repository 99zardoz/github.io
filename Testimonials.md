## Dan Westmorland, Software Team Lead

<i>I’ve worked with Jonathan Shields for about 3 years while he was at NatCen, collaborating on several projects. Throughout that time, he has always impressed me with his attention to detail, strong work ethic, and ability to handle complex technical challenges. Jonathan is a real team player, always pulling his weight and contributing to the success of every project.</i>

<i>He’s also great at managing stakeholder relationships and quickly gets up to speed with complex domains and technologies. No matter what the challenge, Jonathan always finds a way to move things forward.</i>

<i>On top of that, he’s a pleasure to work with—easygoing, fun, and someone I’m always happy to see on a project. I’d welcome the chance to work with him again.</i>

## Clair Hillier, Head of Digital Delivery Management

<i>I worked with Jonathan Shields as a third-party partner for about 7 years while he worked at NatCen. </i>

<i>He was really good to work with; really detail oriented, diligent, conscientious and a smart guy. We worked on a range of projects and he integrated with various project teams across that time. He was really good at managing stakeholders and getting to grips with some complex technologies and domains.  </i>

<i>He was also a pleasure to work with, a good laugh and I would always be pleased if I knew he was joining our projects.</i>

## Stuart Bultitide, IT Development Team Leader

<i>As IT Development Team Leader I managed Jonathan for over five years. Jonathan was a credit to my team and to the National Centre for Social Research (NatCen). Jonathan has many years worth of development experience across a whole range of software languages. He is passionate about what he does and is very knowledgeable. Jonathan is motivated to learn new skills and would always relish a challenge. He is trustworthy, hard working and extremely loyal and I would have no hesitation in recommending him.</i>
