# PowerBI projects

This page includes some personal Power BI projects developed while I was studying for the PL-300 certification.

## COVID Power BI report

I developed a report on COVID during Jan - July 2020 using public domain data from Kaggle.  This uses main bar and line charts with slicers.

The first page shows a table of the top 10 countries by number of confirmed cases at the end of the reporting period.  Clicking a row on the table filters the line charts
to data from that country only.  The line charts show average confirmed cases and deaths across the reporting period for all countries.
