As part of an assignment on my Data Analytics career accelerator course with the London School of Economics I developed a set of Tableau dashboards using data from 2Market, a fictional supermarket.

I enjoyed learning to use Tableau and I think it provides some nice visualisations and features.  The experience is a little smoother than Power BI although at a higher cost.

## The visualisations

I focussed on using the best type of visualisations for each task.  For instance to show average spending across a range of product types, I see no issue with using a bar chart. They are simple and widely understood.  I have added interactive filters to allow the user in this case to select the age groups they wish to compare.

I have included a few screenshots but the dashboards are best viewed on Tableau Public as this allows the interactive filters to be used.

In other cases, I have used for example bubble charts and treemaps which provide a similar function but provided a little variation within my assignment presentation.
There is a tradeoff with the bubble charts as some groups have such small bubbles Tableau does not display the labels.  However I added tooltips so that the labels are shown on mouseover.
